            Lasagna History</a>
    </button>
    </h3>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, 
        flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers
         of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, 
         cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6) ounce cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt, divided or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. 
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons 
            parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
            for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 
            to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese 
            with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 
            noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of 
            the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
            Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with 
            foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch 
            the cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
            Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
